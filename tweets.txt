DON'T be on your best behaviour on a first date. DO be your normal, everyday, relaxed hanging-with-friends behaviour. You want the person to like you for who you actually are, not who you are pretending to be. You will save yourself a lot of wasted time dating people who only like the fake you.

Try to be understanding of people with chronic pain. Some people have pain disabilities you can't see in their joints, back or bones. It is easy to think they should be able to do more, but unless you have experienced sever back pain or similar items it is really hard to understand.
